# CN-Project

This repository bundles two ONOS-based networking scenarios:

- Adaptive Routing (`Adaptive Routing/`)
- Static Routing (`Static Routing/`)

Each scenario has its own configuration steps and execution workflow. For setup, deployment, and troubleshooting guidance, open the `README.md` located inside the respective folder before running any scripts or tools.
